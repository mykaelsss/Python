# # Some optional challenges to assess and refine your understanding:

# # Print the length of the list.

# # Use antoher python built-in function and print the result.

# # Remove an item from the list. Remember to verify that it was removed.

# # Utilize a method from the documentation and print the result.


# # for x in range(0, 10, 2):
# #     print(x)
# # # output: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
# # for x in range(5, 1, -3):
# #     print(x)
# # # output: 5, 2
# for x in range(1, 21):
#     print(x)
# # Challenge: Write a for loop to print all integers from 1 to 20, including 20.



# countries = ["Uganda", "Chile", "Albania", "Saudi Arabia"]

# # Challenge 1: Fix the range!
# for integer in range(0, len(countries)):
#      print("Index:", countries.index(countries[integer]))
#      # Challenge 2: print the index here
#      print("Country:", countries[integer] )
# #     # Challenge 3: print the country here

# Looping over values only...
# for country in countries:
#     print("Country: " , country)
    # Challenge 4: print the country here
